We are here developping an OCR system to know wether a student attendant a certain event or class or not. 
The name.xlsx file is a file containing the names and family names of each student in the info 3 class of 2022 with their respective IDs. The

the code-names.py program will be converting those infos into another excel sheet named presence.xlsx in the format: Name Father Name Family Name assigned to the Id of each student. 

The code-ocr will open the camera of the computer, waits uyntil a command is given(q key)takes a pic of the id and interprets it to get the Matricule of each student. 

The code-presence program will be saving in the same excel sheet the date of the event and which student attended and which student didn't. 
for now it is randomly chosen because the projectis still not finished.

finally the code-email.py program willsend to the doctor the excel file whenever the program is run. 

we hope you do like the project and the work we put into it.

we learned a great deal of informations, as how to use pytessaract and pandas mainly.
